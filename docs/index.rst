The ``scousepy`` package provides a method by which a large amount of complex
astronomical spectral line data can be fitted in a systematic way. A detailed
description of the method (and the original `IDL version
<https://github.com/jdhenshaw/SCOUSE>`_ of the code)
can be found in `Henshaw et al. 2016 <http://ukads.nottingham.ac.uk/abs/2016arXiv160103732H>`_.
In the following pages you will find a :ref:`brief introduction <description>`
to the method as well as a :ref:`tutorial <tutorial>`. The `source code
<https://github.com/jdhenshaw/scousepy>`_ is available on GitHub and comments
and contributions are very welcome.
